# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [1.2.3]

### Added
- Added Sparkle-backed automatic update installation from GitHub Releases, including Sparkle's changelog/install UI and a developer dry-run mode for previewing the latest release update flow.
- Added Razer Naga Pro support over USB (wired and 2.4GHz dongle) and Bluetooth: button remapping across all three swappable side panels (2-button, 6-button, 12-button), grouped clearly in the button mapping table; DPI stages; and full onboard-profile switching/CRUD. Known limitation: onboard profile names for non-active slots can fail to load over Bluetooth due to a pre-existing multi-fragment BLE response reassembly issue that also affects other Bluetooth devices.

### Fixed
- Fixed a Bluetooth vendor-transport bug where multi-fragment responses (e.g. onboard profile metadata, which can span 5+ notify packets) could be truncated if the peripheral hadn't finished streaming before a fixed completion timer fired. The timer now resets on every notification instead of only after the last write.

## [1.2.2]

### Fixed
- Fixed the menu bar DPI stage list so mouse-button onboard profile cycling reloads the active profile's stage table just like the main window.
- Fixed onboard profile support for Basilisk V3 35K by sharing the Basilisk V3 USB-family profile configuration across Basilisk V3, Basilisk V3 Pro, and Basilisk V3 35K.
- Fixed Restore Last Profile so reconnects refresh saved DPI stage tables without forcing the saved active DPI stage over the mouse's current stage.
- Fixed Restore Last Profile lighting after mouse wake, including Bluetooth realtime wake updates and receiver-backed USB recovery.

## [1.2.1]

### Changed
- Device detail headers no longer show serial numbers or live DPI readouts below the device name.

### Fixed
- Fixed Basilisk V3 Pro profile switches and reconnect hydration so reduced DPI stage tables keep driving live DPI-cycle UI updates.
- Fixed Advanced USB software-lighting streams so stale USB sessions are suspended on write or control-heartbeat failures and recover when USB reachability returns after mouse sleep or power-cycle events.

## [1.2.0]

### Highlights
- Added a unified local profile library and profile picker for all supported devices, including single-slot devices. Local profiles can now be created, renamed, copied, deleted, restored on connect, and loaded into compatible onboard slots with supported DPI, button, lighting, and USB wheel-mode settings adapted to the target device.
- Added Night Rider and Basilisk V3 Pro USB Battery Meter advanced lighting presets. Advanced effects now support persisted brightness, resume cleanly after onboard profile switches, and stream the full V3-family USB light-bar range.
- Improved setup and editing workflows with a searchable supported-device table, a fuzzy keybinding picker, modifier chord support, clearer profile-picker loading states, and automatic loading for newly created local profiles.
- Improved USB dongle, sleeping-mouse, and reconnect recovery so receiver-backed devices stay visible when appropriate and recover after wake or replug without restarting OpenSnek.

### Fixed
- Fixed Basilisk V3 Pro USB and Bluetooth button maps so the shared V3-family DPI button slot is editable like the rest of the V3-family layout.
- Fixed reduced-stage HyperSpeed local profiles loaded onto V3 Pro onboard slots so the intended stage count is preserved and DPI cycling does not land on stale hidden stages.
- Fixed USB Custom Frame lighting issues that could spill or rotate colors, and stopped duplicate software-lighting writers during app/service handoff.
- Fixed several dongle-only and sleeping-mouse states that could show stale loading screens, duplicate errors, transient telemetry warnings, disconnected flicker, or delayed recovery during expected USB reconnect paths.
- Hid Advanced software-lighting controls on Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed and Bluetooth devices that cannot stream software effects.

## [1.0.0]

### Highlights
- Added stored onboard profile management for validated Basilisk V3 Pro USB and Bluetooth devices, including list/read/create/rename/update/delete/activate flows, copy-from-slot creation, Synapse-compatible metadata, and profile-backed DPI, button, brightness, and static-color edits.
- Expanded Basilisk V3-family USB support across Basilisk V3 Pro, Basilisk V3 35K, and the mapped wired Basilisk V3 profile with higher-DPI ranges, independent X/Y DPI where supported, wheel-tilt defaults, DPI clutch handling, multi-zone lighting, scroll controls, and more reliable state hydration.
- Added contributor-validated Bluetooth support for the Razer Orochi V2, including DPI stages, battery reporting, and no-RGB capability handling.
- Reworked reconnect, background-service, and passive-HID behavior so selected devices get priority, live DPI/profile changes are followed more reliably, and stale telemetry is less likely to overwrite fresh UI edits.
- Added release packaging/CI, device support docs, Windows BTVS capture automation, and focused probe commands for USB and Bluetooth profile research.
- Removed command-level retries from app and probe paths so command failures surface clearly while transport recovery remains responsible for real connection failures.

## [2026-06-19]

### Added
- Added a service-owned Basilisk V3 Pro USB software lighting engine that streams volatile 14-cell Custom Frame data while OpenSnek is running, with Flame, Scrolling Rainbow, Comet Chase, and Aurora presets plus app UI controls to start and stop the active preset.
- Added a Jellybeans software lighting preset with a pastel palette and one-random-LED-per-tick color changes.
- Extended the USB software lighting effects surface to the wired Basilisk V3 and Basilisk V3 35K underglow profiles using the shared V3-family 14-cell frame assumption.
- Added `OpenSnekProbe usb-lighting-concurrency`, a V3 Pro USB stress probe for comparing serialized Custom Frame streaming against unsafe overlapping feature-report reads/writes.

### Changed
- Normal lighting color/effect applies now stop active software lighting on the selected device, while unrelated DPI, button, poll-rate, scroll, and power setting applies leave the software effect running.
- The Lighting card now separates persistent onboard controls from runtime-only software effects with Onboard and Advanced tabs, and software Custom Frame writes use shorter ACK polling while active effects cause background telemetry reads to reuse cached state.
- Reworked the Lighting card to use compact color-orb popovers for onboard all-zone and per-zone static colors, renamed the onboard effect selector to Preset, and changed Advanced effects to use a bottom Apply action that replaces any previous software stream, plus speed control and editable/resettable per-preset palettes.
- Added a visible stop control for active Advanced lighting animations, standardized the Advanced action tint, made the speed slider white, further tightened Advanced palette color spacing, added an onboard-persistence notice, removed the lightest Flame default palette color, and made Scrolling Rainbow render 200% faster at the displayed 100% speed.
- Advanced software lighting can now be marked Apply on connect, remembering the last applied preset, speed, and palette per device and defaulting the Lighting card to the Advanced tab when enabled.
- Software lighting streams are now owned by physical device identity so replacing an effect cannot leave an older stream running under a transient device ID, remote apply-on-connect starts once per connection, and stopping a software effect reloads the active onboard profile lighting.
- Software lighting replacement is now generation-gated to prevent reentrant start/resume races from leaving untracked frame writers, Stop explicitly reapplies the active profile lighting surface before returning to onboard mode, and Scrolling Rainbow now uses cyclic cell spacing for seamless loops with any palette.
- Flame software lighting now uses seeded irregular flicker timing per LED so color changes feel less uniform.
- The Advanced lighting Apply on connect toggle now sits beside the Apply and Stop controls.
- The Lighting card background now reflects the selected Advanced software-lighting palette instead of staying tied to the onboard static color.
- Jellybeans now uses a more saturated default palette so randomly assigned LED colors are easier to distinguish.
- The Lighting card now opens collapsed with a mode-only summary that shows the active animation name without an Advanced prefix, uses onboard colors again after Advanced effects stop, and can be expanded to edit onboard or Advanced controls.

## [2026-06-18]

### Changed
- Command execution no longer retries at the app or probe level: USB and Bluetooth command failures now surface instead of being hidden by repeated writes/readbacks, and Debug log level shows visible command failures as red command-failed notices with patch context in the log.
- `OpenSnekProbe dpi-set` now performs one post-write verification read and removed the `--verify-retries` / `--verify-delay-ms` flags.
- `OpenSnekProbe usb-lighting-frame` now writes Basilisk V3 Pro USB custom-frame lighting cells via `Class 0x0F Cmd 0x03`. The custom-frame path is documented as volatile/software-driven because the mouse does not restore this state after restart.
- Documented and enabled capture-backed Basilisk V3 Pro Bluetooth sensitivity-clutch writes on slot `0x0F`, including right-click assignment plus 400-DPI and 800-DPI clutch payloads across stored target `4` and live target `1`.
- DPI stage selection from the UI now applies only the selected live stage instead of rewriting the full stage table when stage values were not edited.
- Debug logs now identify DPI active-stage UI mutations, hydrators, backend snapshots, USB read resolution, and active-stage apply requests so stale-state overwrites can be traced from a single repro.
- Basilisk V3 Pro USB active onboard-profile writes now refresh the active selector before readback so back-to-back profile-backed UI edits keep profile hydration available.
- Onboard profile management now opens from a right-aligned active-profile pill in the device overview instead of occupying a persistent detail card.

### Fixed
- DPI stage selection no longer briefly snaps back to the previous stage when stale telemetry arrives before the apply result, including mapped onboard-profile devices whose live DPI readback can lag behind the stored profile update.
- Bluetooth onboard-profile DPI edits no longer let a stale profile refresh briefly roll the visible DPI field and slider back to the previous value while the write is still in flight.
- Bluetooth onboard-profile button binding edits no longer let a stale button readback overwrite the newer local UI edit while the write is still in flight.
- Bluetooth DPI-stage selection now follows live DPI changes from the mouse even when passive telemetry reports a stale active-stage token.
- USB scroll mode controls now follow live wheel-mode changes from the mouse even when the cached active onboard-profile snapshot still has the previous scroll mode.
- USB state refresh now resolves the active DPI stage from the live DPI value when the stage-table active token is stale.
- Selected USB devices with unavailable feature-report telemetry now enter a degraded cooldown instead of repeatedly reissuing full-state reads while passive HID updates show the mouse is still connected.

## [2026-06-16]

### Added
- Added mapped onboard profile CRUD support for validated Basilisk V3 Pro USB and Bluetooth devices, including inventory-backed list/read/create/rename/update/delete/activate flows, UUID/name/owner metadata, mapped DPI/button/brightness/static-color snapshots, slot creation from existing profiles, and guarded write/readback behavior.
- Added reactive onboard profile switching for Basilisk V3 Pro USB and Bluetooth through passive HID profile-cycle detection and direct active-profile readback, so the UI follows hardware profile changes without fingerprinting the whole profile configuration.
- Added an onboard profile manager UI with always-visible slots, active-profile selection, rename/create/delete controls, copy-from-slot creation, profile-operation loading overlays, profile color markers, profile 1 Synapse overwrite guidance, and hard RGB lighting presets.
- Added `OpenSnekProbe usb-profile-clone`, a guarded Basilisk V3 Pro USB repair command that clones Synapse-compatible metadata and mapped profile surfaces from one stored profile to another with strict readback.

### Changed
- Devices with mapped onboard storage now use onboard profiles as the source of truth: selecting an assigned slot activates it, profile-backed edits write the selected onboard profile, same-ID reconnects reread device state, and the legacy On Connect restore control is hidden and ignored for those devices.

### Fixed
- Onboard profile create, rename, and metadata updates now write a Synapse-compatible 64-character owner hash instead of the short `OpenSnek` marker, preventing OpenSnek-created profiles from appearing broken in Synapse while still working on the mouse.

## [2026-06-15]

### Added
- Added an automated Windows BTVS/tshark capture wrapper that emits Synapse correlation artifacts and avoids stale listeners by choosing a fresh port when needed.
- Added Basilisk V3 Pro Bluetooth profile probe commands for reading active/stored targets, creating guarded stored profiles, reading/writing stored button bindings, watching passive profile-cycle HID hints, and selecting active targets.
- Added Basilisk V3 Pro USB profile probe commands for read-only profile sweeps, guarded stored-profile write verification, profile delete/unassign, and active-profile read/select operations.

### Changed
- `OpenSnekProbe bt-profile-create` now fails fast on non-success write ACKs so partially rewritten stored targets are not treated as successful creates.
- The unsafe USB metadata-write probe path is disabled; profile metadata writes are documented but not exposed as a casual probe command.

### Fixed
- `OpenSnekProbe usb-raw --args` byte-list parsing now treats two-digit tokens such as `20` as hex bytes, avoiding accidental decimal-byte writes.
- Basilisk V3 Pro USB active-profile hydration now parses the validated `05:84` response shape even when the response size byte is `0x00`, and prefers that direct active-profile register over stale `00:87` summary telemetry.

## [2026-05-17]

### Added
- Added Bluetooth support for the Razer Orochi V2 (`BT PID 0x0095`) based on contributor-validated hardware behavior. The contributor validated Bluetooth DPI stages (up to 18,000) and battery level, and the profile maps the six on-mouse buttons (left/right/middle/back/forward/DPI) pending button-remap readback validation. The mouse has no RGB, so no lighting controls are exposed. The 2.4 GHz HyperSpeed dongle path is not yet supported.

### Fixed
- USB and Bluetooth keyboard binding capture now support modifier shortcuts such as `Command + [` by writing the Basilisk-family keyboard modifier byte instead of silently capturing only the base key.
- Device detail views now hide the lighting card for mice whose shipped profile declares no lighting zones, effects, or LED IDs, instead of always showing the controls regardless of hardware capability.
- Bluetooth state now reports lighting as unsupported for no-RGB profiles instead of exposing a stale lighting capability to backend and snapshot consumers.

## [2026-05-03]

### Added
- Device detail views now include a per-mouse `On Connect` setting that lets you either read the current live settings from the mouse or restore the last full OpenSnek-owned setup when that mouse reconnects. The restore mode is intended for shared-device and Synapse workflows where vendor software can overwrite DPI, lighting, and button mappings on reconnect.
- Dev builds now expose a debug-only `Enable setting storage` switch in Settings. Turning it off lets you apply live mouse changes without updating OpenSnek's saved reconnect snapshot, which makes it possible to verify restart and reconnect rehydration locally without involving Synapse on another machine.

### Fixed
- Foreground window mode now fast-polls only the selected device instead of every visible device. This prevents an inactive dongle or second mouse from stealing serialized bridge time and making Bluetooth real-time DPI updates lag or drop while you are using another device.
- Foreground window mode now also limits full-state refresh polling to the selected device and avoids auto-falling from a selected Bluetooth mouse onto a same-identity USB twin during transient dongle churn. This prevents inactive USB telemetry failures from stalling the selected Bluetooth mouse and keeps the main app from bouncing onto the wrong transport when the Bluetooth HID registration briefly flaps.
- Background-service interactive polling now prioritizes the device selected in the full app instead of refreshing every visible mouse. When a Bluetooth mouse is selected, inactive USB dongles and other non-selected devices stop competing for serialized bridge time, and selection-driven priority now follows the user immediately when they switch devices.
- Reconnect restores now reapply the full last OpenSnek-owned device snapshot instead of only remembered lighting state. When enabled, reconnects restore DPI stages, active DPI, poll rate, power settings, scroll settings, lighting, and button bindings without replacing that snapshot from passive device readback, and foreground refresh polls now stay paused until that restore finishes so reconnects do not briefly snap back to stale DPI state mid-apply.
- Unrelated applies such as DPI or button changes no longer overwrite the saved reconnect lighting snapshot with stale editor lighting state. Reconnect restore now preserves the last stored lighting color/effect/zone until you actually change lighting, which prevents reconnects from unexpectedly reverting to an older color.
- Successful lighting applies now stamp the saved reconnect snapshot from the actual applied color/effect payload instead of the editor's later transient state, which fixes Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed reconnects restoring an older color after in-flight UI changes.
- USB reconnect restores no longer force a full state read after every restored button slot. OpenSnek now replays the button restore writes first and performs one final verification read at the end, which cuts the worst reconnect lag substantially on multi-button restores.
- The main window now keeps following live DPI-stage changes after reconnect restore is enabled. Recent fast DPI updates are treated as newer than stale full-state reads, so the status item and the selected-device editor stay in sync instead of the editor snapping back to an older stage.
- Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed now always uses the local restore-on-connect path internally, because OpenSnek cannot fully read its live settings back from the mouse after reconnect.

## [2026-04-06]

### Fixed
- Basilisk V3 35K USB sleep-timeout writes now fall back to readback verification when the initial `0x07:0x03` feature-report write does not return a success ACK. This keeps the setting usable on the 35K's transient reconnect path instead of surfacing a false failure as soon as the write response goes missing.

## [2026-04-04]

### Fixed
- Basilisk V3 Pro Bluetooth battery UI no longer treats the BLE `batteryStatus` byte as a reliable charging flag. Standalone BT sessions now show the regular battery indicator instead of a charging bolt unless an available USB fallback session confirms that the mouse is actually charging.

## [2026-04-03]

### Fixed
- Basilisk V3-family USB wheel-tilt defaults and `Scroll Left` / `Scroll Right` remaps now use the observed working Synapse-written function blocks `0e036800140000` / `0e036900140000` instead of the older plain mouse-action assumption. The exact block was read back from an attached Basilisk V3 Pro and is now applied across the shared V3 / V3 Pro / 35K USB family.
- Basilisk V3 Pro Bluetooth `Scroll Left` / `Scroll Right` and wheel-tilt default restore now use the observed working raw function blocks `0e036800140000` / `0e036900140000` instead of the older plain mouse-action BLE encoding.

## [2026-03-30]

### Fixed
- Restored main-window frames are now clamped back onto a currently visible display before the window is shown, so stale saved positions from older display layouts no longer reopen the app nearly off-screen or at an unexpectedly shrunken size.
- Showing the full app from the menu bar service now restores the last stable user-sized window frame instead of re-saving transient startup or shutdown sizes, so `Show OpenSnek` reopens the main window where you left it.
- Reopening the full app now reapplies the shared custom window chrome before the main window is shown, so `Show OpenSnek` and Dock reopens keep the hidden title bar styling instead of falling back to the standard macOS window chrome.

## [2026-03-29]

### Added
- Added `docs/DEVICE_SUPPORT.md`, a per-device USB/Bluetooth support matrix that highlights shipped coverage and the main missing features for each supported profile.

### Fixed
- Bluetooth passive-HID battery refreshes in the background service now honor the active slow-poll cadence instead of an older fixed defer window, so the Basilisk V3 Pro battery meter updates regularly in the menu bar and other service-driven UI even while passive DPI heartbeats are healthy.
- Fast DPI-only refreshes no longer advance the stable telemetry freshness timestamp, so USB battery reads keep surfacing through the slow poller and the menu bar battery meter does not get stuck behind repeated DPI cache updates.

## [2026-03-28]

### Fixed
- Bluetooth battery and other full-state telemetry no longer get stuck behind newer DPI-only cache updates. When a slower full read finishes after a passive HID or fast-DPI refresh, OpenSnek now preserves the newer DPI stage state while still applying the fresh battery and stable telemetry fields instead of dropping that full read as stale until restart.
- HID feature-report reads now require the response transaction ID to match the request transaction ID, so repeated battery polls can no longer accept an older cached `07:80` reply as fresh telemetry just because the command class, command ID, and CRC still match.

## [2026-03-25]

### Fixed
- The Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed Bluetooth battery indicator no longer shows a charging bolt all the time; OpenSnek now treats that AA-powered profile as not charging instead of reusing the Basilisk V3 Pro's Bluetooth status-byte interpretation.
- Fresh main-window launches now default to the smallest width that still lands in the intended two-column detail layout, instead of opening wider than necessary.
- In dev builds, Settings now includes a debug-only `Remember window size` switch, and relaunching the full app from the menu bar now restores the saved frame before the window is shown so the main window no longer pops from the default size to the remembered size.
- The main window now saves its latest frame explicitly on move, resize, and close, so relaunches restore the last size reliably instead of falling back to the default window dimensions.
- USB state reads no longer latch a stale `Input Monitoring` denial after sleep/wake or transient HID resume failures; OpenSnek now retries fresh feature-report exchanges instead of getting stuck in a permission-error loop until restart.
- The Basilisk V3 Pro wired USB path is now recognized when macOS reports `VID:PID 1532:00AA`; OpenSnek aliases that cable PID onto the existing Basilisk V3 Pro USB profile instead of treating the mouse as unsupported.
- The button-mapping UI no longer exposes onboard profile load/store controls for Basilisk V3-family USB mice while active-profile selection is being revalidated; the app now avoids presenting profile state it cannot yet prove matches the mouse.
- USB button edits on multi-profile mice once again auto-apply directly to the live layer and persist back to the mouse's durable base slot, even if the editor was previously pointed at another profile source.
- The empty-state supported-devices list no longer shows a `Mapped` badge on the regular Basilisk V3 row, even though the shipped V3 USB profile still remains OpenRazer-backed and unvalidated internally.
- Battery readouts now turn red when the live charge falls at or below the device's configured low-battery threshold, and the menu bar status icon switches from the normal OpenSnek glyph to a low-battery indicator in that state.
- In the device detail two-column layout, the right column now contains only the `Lighting` and `Buttons` cards so the control stack reads with a more balanced split.
- The main app window now restores its last saved size on relaunch instead of always reopening at the default dimensions.
- The lighting card background for multi-zone static colors now reflects the real per-zone colors in mouse order instead of using placeholder accent slices, while uniform or `all zones` states keep the styled accent gradient instead of flattening into a solid fill.
- USB button-binding caches and reconnect identity now ignore placeholder serials like `000000000000`, which prevents stale remap snapshots from being reused as if they belonged to a uniquely identified mouse.
- USB button profiles now hydrate strictly from mouse readback instead of local cached bindings, so reconnects no longer auto-reapply stale USB remaps; Bluetooth still remembers the last known button state in the UI when readback is unavailable.
- USB button writes now fail unless every requested layer succeeds, so OpenSnek no longer treats a volatile direct-layer-only update as a successful persistent remap.
- Editing a projected stored USB button profile now persists changes back to the live/base slot `1` as well as the direct layer, so those edits survive mouse sleep/wake instead of snapping back to stale base bindings.
- DPI sliders now use a multi-stage curve tuned for high-DPI mice: `2K` lands at `50%`, `10K` lands at `75%`, higher ranges ramp in additional coarser stages up to each device max, and the slider shows tick markers at every scale-change anchor.
- The menu bar DPI editor once again shows a live slider for scalar stages on supported mice, while X/Y-capable stages now expand to separate `X` and `Y` sliders only when the active stage is actually split across axes.
- DPI text entry fields now keep exact integer values instead of snapping the visible editor back through the slider's 100-DPI step size while you type.
- The `Start at login` toggle now stays synchronized between the full app Settings window and the menu bar service menu, even when one process changes the shared preference while the other is already running.
- The device header now shows its connection diagnostics from the connection-status badge instead of the adjacent USB/Bluetooth transport pill, so the hover target matches the actual connection state and no duplicate transport hover remains.
- The button bindings card no longer shows a stale `Profiles` notice banner when there are no profile load/store controls present.
- Static multi-zone lighting now edits one concrete zone at a time, switching zones no longer writes color changes on its own, and `Apply Color to All Zones` is now a separate explicit action instead of a fragile `All Zones` picker state.

## [2026-03-24]

### Added
- OpenSnek now has a saved button-profile library. Button layouts can be named, reused across devices, loaded into the live editor, and written into onboard mouse storage slots.
- OpenSnek now recognizes the wired Razer Basilisk V3 (`USB PID 0x0099`) with an OpenRazer-backed USB device profile. The new profile currently follows the Basilisk V3 35K USB layout for button remap slots, lighting zones, passive DPI listener matching, and onboard-profile count, while capping DPI edits/readback at the Basilisk V3's `26,000` DPI window.
- The README support matrix and the app's empty-state supported-device list now explicitly include the wired Basilisk V3, with the app surfacing it as a mapped supported profile rather than leaving it implied.
- Settings now include a destructive `Wipe Local Storage` action that clears OpenSnek's saved preferences, cached device edits, background-service state, launch-at-login artifact, and local log files so users can reset the app to a clean local state without manually digging through `UserDefaults` or `~/Library` paths.

### Fixed
- Wheel-tilt buttons now hydrate like the other stock mouse bindings: if tilt-left or tilt-right is still on the device default, the button editor selects `Default` instead of showing a redundant explicit `Scroll Left` / `Scroll Right` assignment.
- DPI stage editing on the Basilisk V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 35K now preserves and writes independent X/Y DPI values instead of forcing both axes to the same number.
- USB button-profile support on the Basilisk V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 35K now follows the same five-slot model: slot 1 is the live/base profile and slots 2 through 5 are stored button layouts.
- The macOS button-remap UI now uses an explicit `Profiles` load/store workflow with local saved profiles, onboard slot loading, slot-to-profile name matching, and direct editing of the live/base profile.
- Button remap edits now auto-apply only the slot you changed, keep the editor stable during readback, and show profile-operation busy state only for full profile loads and saves.
- Turbo configuration now works consistently for turbo-capable mouse bindings as well as keyboard bindings, and the 35K now exposes `DPI Clutch` like the V3 Pro.
- USB mice now wait 2 seconds after connect/reconnect before the first feature-report reads are sent, which avoids querying the 35K too early while still letting the device appear in the UI immediately.
- USB button hydration and reconnect recovery are more reliable: switching devices or reconnecting no longer leaves stale/default bindings on screen, reconnects no longer wait as long for usable state, and USB multi-profile mice no longer eagerly sweep every stored slot on connect.
- Connect-time lighting restore is now limited to the Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed. The Basilisk V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 35K keep their own hardware lighting state, while the app hydrates their lighting UI from remembered color/effect values without writing that state back on connect.
- Choosing `Default` for special USB button slots now writes the correct semantic default action, so device-specific defaults such as the 35K DPI-cycle button behave correctly without manually reassigning them.

## [2026-03-23]

### Fixed
- Release DMG backgrounds now render at the full default Finder window height, so the styled installer artwork no longer leaves an uncovered vertical strip when the DMG first opens.

## [2026-03-22]

### Fixed
- Wheel-tilt bindings on Basilisk V3 Pro / 35K now restore to horizontal scroll instead of right click, and the button editor exposes `Scroll Left` / `Scroll Right` as assignable actions on supported profiles.
- When a device appears in the sidebar before its first live state read finishes, the detail pane now shows a lighter-weight loading screen with a spinner instead of the old text-heavy unavailable screen, and selected devices without cached state now kick off their first refresh immediately from controller-side selection handling to reduce connect-to-controls delay.
- Passive HID DPI fallback/correction scheduling now tracks every visible local device instead of only the selected one, so concurrent USB and Bluetooth mice can both keep their passive-stream upgrade path and real-time watchdog active in the same app/service session.
- Switching device tabs no longer blocks on fresh USB button-binding readback for a device that was already hydrated earlier in the session. The UI now reuses cached per-device editor state immediately and refreshes any USB button readback in the background instead of tying tab selection responsiveness to control-transport reads.
- Keyboard button-remap rows now keep the `Turbo` toggle inline with the key picker, while the turbo-rate slider stays on its own line underneath so enabling turbo does not reshuffle the key-selection controls.
- Release builds now re-check GitHub for app updates once every 24 hours while the foreground app keeps running, instead of only checking again after a restart.

## [2026-03-21]

### Added
- Dev builds now expose two Settings toggles for transport debugging: one disables periodic runtime polling and the other disables passive HID DPI listeners, with both preferences persisted in `UserDefaults` so they survive app and menu-bar-service restarts.

### Fixed
- `./run.sh` now asks the app to quit cleanly before falling back to process killing, successful button-binding writes flush their `UserDefaults` save immediately, and app relaunch now rehydrates persisted button remaps on the startup/snapshot paths that populate the selected-device editor state. That keeps previously applied remaps visible after restarting the app.
- Button remapping for `Keyboard Key` actions now supports the broader validated keyboard HID set exposed by OpenRazer-style key catalogs, including modifiers, arrows, navigation keys, function keys, and keypad keys. The old freeform text box has been replaced with a dedicated key badge, direct key recorder, and categorized browser so non-text bindings are practical to assign.
- DPI text entry and staged/clutch DPI writes now clamp to the selected device profile’s supported ceiling, while the DPI sliders stop at `6,000` for easier control. Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed devices still top out at `18,000` DPI in text entry, while higher-end Basilisk models keep their broader per-device ranges.
- `OpenSnek/project.yml` is now the only checked-in Xcode source of truth. `OpenSnek/OpenSnek.xcodeproj` is generated on demand, gitignored, and no longer validated as a tracked sync artifact, which removes the recurring stale-project drift between the spec and the committed Xcode project.
- On macOS 15.x, opening the main app window now skips the custom transparent/unified title-bar chrome path that could make AppKit surface a duplicate OpenSnek icon in the wrong part of the window title bar; newer macOS versions keep the existing window styling.
- `./run.sh` / `build_macos_app.sh` now generate a fresh temporary Xcode project from `project.yml`, build against `generic/platform=macOS`, and print the real compiler diagnostics plus full log path on `xcodebuild` failure instead of hiding the root cause behind a generic `EmitSwiftModule` error when the checked-in `.xcodeproj` is stale.
- Passive HID DPI monitoring on Bluetooth now recreates its callback `IOHIDDevice` on the monitor thread from the underlying registry service before opening and scheduling it. The previous implementation reused a discovery-thread wrapper across run loops, which could degrade into heartbeat-only traffic with no real DPI callbacks until polling recovered.
- Passive HID listener registrations now reuse a stable HID registry identity instead of raw `IOHIDDevice` wrapper pointer identity, so routine `listDevices()` refreshes no longer tear down and recreate the passive callback stream just because macOS handed discovery a new wrapper object for the same physical mouse.
- The full app no longer eagerly starts its own local bridge backend when background-service mode is enabled, which prevents the foreground UI process from competing with the menu-bar service for the same passive HID DPI stream before remote transport finishes bootstrapping.
- Passive HID DPI updates no longer depend on runtime polling to seed an initial device state first; in developer HID-only mode the first observed DPI event now bootstraps a minimal live state and keeps that fallback snapshot fresh until a full device read replaces it.
- Opening the compact menu no longer forces a destructive `IOHIDManager` rebuild just to refresh the Input Monitoring badge, which could break an otherwise healthy passive HID DPI stream when polling was disabled.
- Bluetooth passive DPI reconciliation no longer masks every mismatched poll result after a HID event; it now only hides reads that still match the pre-event state, which reduces false “stale read” lag and unnecessary fallback resets during rapid DPI cycling.
- Routine Input Monitoring status refreshes now reuse the existing HID manager across both the full app and the background-service RPC path, so opening Settings or toggling developer transport options no longer tears down the passive listener right before polling is disabled.
- The menu bar status badge no longer flips to `Reconnecting` after an idle gap when Bluetooth passive HID heartbeats are still fresh; a healthy passive stream now keeps the compact status pill in the connected state even if the last full telemetry snapshot is older.
- The background service now skips its `1s` real-time DPI watchdog poll while Bluetooth passive HID heartbeats are still fresh, then automatically re-enables that watchdog once the heartbeat goes stale. This trims idle background CPU without changing reconnect behavior when the passive stream actually degrades.
- The background service now observes macOS sleep/wake notifications, suspends its runtime polling while the system is sleeping, clears stale remote-client presence on sleep, and resumes with one immediate refresh on wake instead of carrying the higher interactive cadence across a laptop sleep cycle.
- The background service now keeps its `4s` / `8s` idle discovery and state cadence, but the slower `1s` fallback fast-DPI watchdog only stays active for devices that are actually on polling fallback; healthy passive HID streaming paths no longer keep the fast poller running.
- The full app and background service now use a single loopback TCP transport for unary RPCs, pushed state updates, remote-client presence, and `Settings…` handoff, which removes the older distributed-notification side channel and cleans up teardown races around mixed IPC paths.

## [2026-03-15]

### Fixed
- Local/development app builds now identify themselves with a `Dev Build` sidebar banner and skip GitHub release update checks, instead of showing a misleading upgrade prompt that is only relevant to shipped release builds.
- The Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed USB profile (`0x00B9`) now enables the shared passive HID DPI listener tuple used by the other supported USB Basilisk profiles, so the app can upgrade that device from polling fallback to real-time HID monitoring once macOS delivers live DPI callbacks.
- The background menu bar service now keeps a slower fast-DPI fallback poll alive for the selected device only when it is actually stuck on polling fallback, instead of also hammering Bluetooth devices that are merely re-arming passive HID listeners in `Listening` state after a registration reset.
- Bluetooth passive DPI listeners now keep their observed real-time state across routine HID target rebuilds for the same logical device, which avoids re-enabling fallback polling and repeated listener churn during rapid on-device DPI cycling.
- Passive HID listener reuse now rebuilds the underlying registration when macOS swaps in a new `IOHIDDevice` object for the same logical target, which fixes Bluetooth sessions getting stuck indefinitely in `Listening for first HID event` after reconnect/re-enumeration.
- Bluetooth real-time DPI now keeps a low-rate watchdog fast read alive for the selected device, and a missed on-device stage change automatically demotes the stale passive-HID path back to fallback polling and re-arms the listener instead of staying stuck in a dead `realTimeHID` state forever.
- Bluetooth passive HID report handling now classifies the frequent `05 05 10 ...` packets as heartbeat/status traffic separate from actual `05 05 02 ...` DPI packets, and the app surfaces that as `HID stream active` immediately instead of waiting forever on `Listening for first HID event` when the listener is alive but no DPI change has happened yet.
- Selected devices now keep a low-rate fast DPI correction read alive even after passive real-time HID becomes active, so an occasional missed passive packet gets reconciled quickly on both USB and Bluetooth instead of leaving the UI stale until the next manual change.
- Bluetooth full-state refreshes now back off while heartbeat-backed real-time HID is healthy, which avoids repeatedly reopening the slower serialized BLE telemetry lane during active DPI bursts.
- The menu bar service now treats selected-device DPI activity as a short interactive burst and uses a tighter service-only correction cadence, so the status item updates much faster after on-device DPI changes without restoring the heavier foreground polling profile full-time.

## [2026-03-14]

### Fixed
- The Basilisk V3 35K USB profile (`0x00CB`) now enables the same passive HID DPI listener tuple used by the V3 Pro USB path, so the app can upgrade that device from polling fallback to real-time HID monitoring once macOS delivers live DPI callbacks.

## [2026-03-13]

### Added
- `OpenSnekProbe` now exposes USB lighting inspection/write commands for supported USB profiles, including per-zone fanout for multi-zone devices such as the Basilisk V3 Pro (`scroll_wheel = 0x01`, `logo = 0x04`, `underglow = 0x0A`) and payload logging for the exact `0x0F` matrix writes sent to each zone.
- `OpenSnekProbe` now exposes Bluetooth lighting inspection/write commands for the Basilisk V3 Pro, including per-zone brightness/color reads and fanout writes across `scroll_wheel`, `logo`, and `underglow`.

### Changed
- The app’s user-facing brand and bundle name now use `OpenSnek` consistently, and launch-at-startup refreshes any stale login launch-agent configuration that still points at the legacy app bundle path.
- Release links, in-app update checks, and bug-report URLs now point at the renamed GitHub repository path `gh123man/OpenSnek`.
- The release workflow now publishes the latest `CHANGELOG.md` section as the GitHub Release notes instead of using GitHub's autogenerated commit-range summary.

### Fixed
- The background menu bar service now suppresses its transient SwiftUI startup window before it becomes visible, which removes the brief window flash when the app starts or when `Menu bar icon` is turned on.
- Battery icons in the menu bar widget and main device header now use the same adaptive SF Symbol fill based on the current percentage, instead of mixing coarse 25% buckets in one surface and a hardcoded non-charging icon in the other.
- Bluetooth battery status reads no longer treat a missing vendor charging value as `not charging`, and a fresh battery refresh with unknown charge state now clears any stale charging bolt instead of keeping an older `charging` result forever.
- USB multi-zone static lighting now remembers the last applied color per zone instead of sharing one device-wide color cache across `All Zones`, `Logo`, `Scroll Wheel`, and `Underglow`.
- The Basilisk V3 Pro Bluetooth path now uses the validated per-zone BLE lighting keys (`10 83`/`10 03` for static color, `10 85`/`10 05` for brightness), re-enables lighting controls in the macOS app, and restores saved zone-specific static colors instead of treating that device as lighting-disabled.
- Bluetooth fast DPI/state reads now proactively re-arm passive HID listeners until the first live DPI event arrives, so a stale listener registration can recover without requiring a full app relaunch.

## [2026-03-12]

### Added
- Bluetooth device-profile support for Razer Basilisk V3 Pro (`0x00AC`) in the shared Swift registry and macOS app, including direct PID matching, `BSK V3 PRO` fallback-name resolution, and the validated Bluetooth button layout for the shared primary controls plus wheel-tilt buttons.

### Fixed
- The menu bar dropdown now includes a `Start at login` toggle between `Settings…` and `Quit`, so the login-launch setting is available in the compact menu where the background service already lives.
- Toggling `Start at login` no longer shows a redundant transient status message on success; the menu state changes silently unless there is an actual error.
- Opening the menu bar dropdown now refreshes its HID/connection diagnostics immediately, so the compact `Connected` indicator stays in sync with the newer main-window listening-vs-fallback status logic.
- Fast DPI polling no longer downgrades a device from `Listening for first HID event` to `Polling fallback active`, which stops the compact `Connected` indicator from flapping between green and yellow while passive HID is armed but still waiting for its first live event.
- The Swift BLE vendor parser now accepts the Basilisk V3 Pro Bluetooth notify framing variant (8-byte notify header plus short final payload fragments), which unlocks live DPI, battery, brightness, sleep-timeout, and button-remap traffic on the V3 Pro Bluetooth path instead of treating those replies as empty.
- The Basilisk V3 Pro Bluetooth profile now subscribes to the validated passive HID DPI report stream (`05 05 02 ...`) on macOS, so on-device DPI-stage changes can drive immediate real-time UI updates instead of staying stuck on polling fallback.
- OpenSnek now detects when macOS blocks HID access for the active app/service host, surfaces that state in the main UI and Settings, and adds a Settings action to reset the app's TCC permissions so Input Monitoring can be re-tested without leaving the app.
- The main window and menu bar now keep the device pill labeled `Connected`, stay green while OpenSnek is listening for the first passive HID event, switch to a warning yellow only when real-time HID is actually unavailable and the app is stuck on polling fallback, and expose per-protocol hover details for control transport, telemetry, real-time HID, and Input Monitoring status.
- Hovering the main transport pill now shows a fuller connection tooltip with the active transport, live telemetry state, control transport, and any relevant real-time HID/Input Monitoring detail.
- When the full app attaches to the background service, it now does one eager device/state bootstrap through the service before settling into snapshot-only updates, which restores faster initial battery and selected-device hydration when the service already has live state cached.
- On the validated Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed Bluetooth path (`0x00BA`), OpenSnek now listens for passive HID DPI input reports and applies those cached-state updates immediately, then disables Bluetooth fast DPI polling for that device after the first live passive event is observed.
- On the validated Basilisk V3 Pro USB path (`0x00AB`), OpenSnek now listens for the mouse's passive DPI input report and applies those updates to cached state immediately, removing the old 200 ms fast-poll lag for on-device DPI changes while keeping the slower full USB state poll for other controls.
- Passive HID DPI updates no longer get overwritten by slower stale state refreshes, and repeatedly failing non-selected devices now back off instead of re-running full state polls every cycle.
- A USB dongle that is attached without its paired mouse no longer burns a second full HID candidate sweep on every failed state read, which reduces contention with the live Bluetooth path and makes that idle-dongle state behave more gracefully.
- Bluetooth HID discovery now drops stale HID-only entries when CoreBluetooth no longer reports an active vendor peripheral, reconnects re-enable fast DPI fallback until a fresh passive HID event is seen again, and selected devices stop showing cached state as live after a real disconnect.
- macOS HID attach/detach events now drive device presence updates directly, so unplugging a USB dongle removes it from the UI immediately, reconnects invalidate stale backend caches even when the logical device ID stays the same, and passive HID DPI listeners get re-armed on both USB and Bluetooth reconnects instead of waiting for the next periodic device poll.
- Bluetooth attach events now kick off the vendor control-session warm-up immediately instead of waiting for the first telemetry read, reconnects can reuse the last known Bluetooth state as soon as that control link is ready, and device-presence refreshes no longer sit behind a fixed settle delay before the first reconnect/disconnect update reaches the UI.
- When the Basilisk V3 Pro USB path comes back healthy after reconnect or a telemetry outage, successful USB reads now proactively rebuild the passive HID DPI listener until a live input report is observed again, so the app can upgrade back from fallback polling instead of staying stuck there.
- The bridge now keeps its HID discovery manager alive while the app is running, which lets the Basilisk V3 Pro USB passive DPI listener continue receiving live input reports after device discovery instead of going silent once enumeration finished.
- USB fast DPI polling now stays enabled until that passive Basilisk V3 Pro input report is actually observed at runtime, preventing a regression to the slower full-state poll when macOS registers the listener but does not deliver live HID events.
- When the background service is driving the UI, interactive USB fast DPI polling now falls back to the service's selected device if a remote-client presence ping arrives without an explicit selected-device ID, preventing another regression to the slower 2-second full-state refresh.
- Connection-degraded devices now report `Reconnecting` instead of `Poll Delayed`, the main and compact UIs lock their editing controls until live telemetry is healthy again, and the diagnostics sheet now spells out physical presence plus whether DPI updates are coming from polling fallback or real-time HID.
- Bluetooth passive HID DPI cycles now seed the existing BLE stale-read mask, and remote service snapshots now ignore older per-device state, which reduces the remaining Bluetooth active-stage snap-back after very fast on-device DPI switching.
- Reduced idle background-service CPU usage by stopping redundant 200 ms runtime wakeups and avoiding unnecessary remote-client-presence state churn that kept the menu bar UI relayout path active even when the service was idle.
- When the background service is already running, clicking the Dock icon or otherwise reopening the app now hands off to a real windowed app instance instead of leaving the accessory-only service process active with no visible UI.
- Choosing `Quit` from the menu bar service now closes both the compact service and any open full app window instances, instead of only terminating the service process.
- Multi-device service ownership now keeps baseline state polling per-device instead of per-selected-device, so the menu bar UI and main window can stay focused on different mice without either one going stale or falling into `Poll Delayed`.
- Cross-process service snapshots no longer force both UIs onto the same "last changed" device; each UI now keeps its own selection while still receiving live state updates for every connected mouse.
- Launch and reconnect now reapply the last persisted lighting state for supported mice instead of leaving devices at firmware green, and USB static-color restores now remember the last targeted lighting zone.
- Removed the transient `Stage x -> y DPI applied` status message because the live UI already reflects successful DPI changes directly.
- The `Menu bar icon` preference now keeps an upgrade user's stored choice intact; only installs without a saved preference pick up the default-on behavior.
- Choosing `Quit` from the menu bar service now only ends the current background session; it no longer silently turns off `Menu bar icon` or clears `Start at login`.
- Toggling `Launch menu bar service at startup` no longer blocks the UI or starts a second service/app instance immediately; it now only updates the launch-agent registration for the next login, while the separate `Enable menu bar service` toggle continues to control the current session.
- Restored the clear full-window title bar styling after the title bar icon removal accidentally dropped the shared window chrome configurator along with the accessory view.
- Removed the experimental main-window title bar icon, and the menu bar service `Settings…` action now uses SwiftUI's settings scene opener so it reliably opens the app settings window again.
- The menu bar service now reuses an already-open full app window when you choose `Show OpenSnek`, bringing the existing app to the foreground instead of spawning duplicate full app instances.
- The menu bar service now publishes a real localhost IPC endpoint instead of trying to serialize an `NSXPCListenerEndpoint` into defaults, which restores shared backend ownership when the main window and background service are open together and prevents dual-process USB contention.
- When the background service is enabled, the full app now follows a service-published snapshot feed instead of polling the service for steady-state device/state updates, so hardware polling stays service-owned and both UIs converge from the same live snapshot stream.
- Remote UI clients now send a lightweight active-presence heartbeat to the service so the service keeps its faster interactive polling cadence while the full window is open, instead of dropping back to idle timing.
- The macOS app now keeps live telemetry and DPI/apply flows attached to the currently selected physical mouse even when the runtime device ID shifts during polling, avoiding `Poll Delayed` UI freezes and dropped apply/readback updates after recent multi-device safety changes.
- The full app now adopts an already-running menu bar service as its hardware backend even if local service preferences are stale, preventing dual-process USB/HID contention when the compact widget and main window are open at the same time.

### Changed
- `OpenSnekProbe` now includes `usb-input-listen` and `usb-input-values` so USB HID bring-up can capture raw input-report and HID-value callback traffic across every exposed Razer USB interface, which made it possible to confirm that the attached Basilisk V3 Pro still produces zero macOS HID callbacks during live DPI-cycle probing on this host.
- The menu bar widget now includes a device picker when multiple supported mice are connected, and the service tracks active selections per UI so only the devices currently in use get the faster interactive DPI polling path.
- The menu bar device picker now follows the last device with meaningful DPI/config activity in the service process, so the compact UI shifts to whichever mouse was just touched without forcing the full app to change selection.
- The menu bar widget now renders each stage pill with its actual DPI value, uses a full-width device picker control, and briefly swaps the status-item glyph for a stacked `DPI` + raw-value badge after live on-device DPI changes.

## [2026-03-11]

### Added
- USB device-profile support for Razer Basilisk V3 Pro (`0x00AB`) in the shared Swift registry and macOS app, with the observed lighting-zone layout, validated wheel-tilt slots, and documented fixed clutch/profile controls.
- `OpenSnekProbe` USB commands now accept `--pid 0x....` so bring-up and raw probes can target one attached Razer USB device without hopping between multiple mice.

### Fixed
- The Basilisk V3 Pro USB profile now exposes the validated clutch / DPI-clutch slot (`0x0F`) as an editable button with its observed native restore block (`06 05 05 01 90 01 90`).
- The button-binding UI now exposes `DPI Clutch` as a V3 Pro-only USB remap option after probe validation showed the clutch payload can be assigned to other writable buttons, not just the native clutch slot.
- `DPI Clutch` is now a configurable V3 Pro-only USB action in the app and probe CLI, with the held DPI value encoded into the clutch payload instead of being fixed at the observed 400-DPI default.
- Basilisk V3 Pro profile-button probing now documents the observed remap path on slot `0x6A` but keeps it hidden in the shipped UI because repeated USB write/readback cycles were not yet stable enough to trust.
- Extended Basilisk USB button hydration now treats Basilisk V3 Pro `0x02:0x8C` reads like the other 35K-style offset layout while keeping unsupported V3 Pro slots out of the shipped visible/writable profile.
- Restoring the Basilisk V3 35K top DPI button now preserves its observed default USB payload (`04 02 0F 7B 00 00 00`) instead of falling back to the generic DPI-cycle block.

### Changed
- Fresh installs now default the menu bar icon to enabled, and the settings labels now read `Menu bar icon` and `Start at login` to match the intended behavior more closely.
- The menu bar status glyph and the full app title bar now use the provided `snek-menu.png` branding at a smaller fitted size, and local `.dist` bundle builds now copy that resource into the app so the icon shows up outside Xcode builds.
- Standardized app-icon generation around `OpenSnek/Branding/AppIcon-master.png` so the checked-in asset catalog, local `.app` bundle builds, and DMG artwork all use the same source image.
- Reduced the exported icon's optical size slightly to give the Dock icon more breathing room on macOS versions where the previous full-bleed artwork read as oversized.
- The menu bar widget now uses a custom status-item glyph with compact live-DPI text, clearer action labels, battery icon + percentage, and larger DPI stage hit targets in both the compact widget and the full app; the redundant manual refresh row and misleading chevron affordances were removed.

## [2026-03-10]

### Added
- An optional menu bar background service for the macOS app, including a compact current-stage DPI widget with battery/status readout, quick refresh, and a fast path to launch the full windowed app while sharing the same backend owner.
- Background-service settings in the macOS app for enabling the widget process and launching it automatically at startup, plus service-side logs under `~/Library/Logs/OpenSnek/`.
- USB device-profile support for Razer Basilisk V3 35K (`0x00CB`) in the macOS app and shared Swift support layers, including its own button layout metadata and three-zone USB lighting IDs.
- `OpenSnekProbe usb-raw`, a generic USB HID feature-report inspector for new-device bring-up and protocol verification.
- Shared button-slot access metadata now distinguishes editable, protocol-read-only, and software-read-only controls so future device bring-up can document non-remappable buttons explicitly.
- A per-device Diagnostics sheet in the macOS app, including generic selected-device views, with a copyable text dump of device identity, support profile, topology, capabilities, live state, and current app warnings for bug reports.
- A GitHub-ready diagnostics payload flow in Settings, plus a bug-report issue template that tells users how to generate and paste that payload.

### Fixed
- Bluetooth fallback discovery no longer aliases every connected Razer BLE peripheral to the supported Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed profile when HID permission is denied; unsupported BLE devices now stay generic/unsupported until an exact Bluetooth profile match is added.
- Unsupported Razer USB devices no longer get hidden behind the generic unsupported screen; OpenSnek now allows USB probing on unknown Razer mice, shows a warning that support is partial, and only exposes USB controls that responded during live capability probing. Unsupported Bluetooth devices remain gated to the explicit supported-device list.
- Bluetooth vendor exchanges now target the selected device by peripheral name instead of whichever connected Razer BLE peripheral CoreBluetooth returns first, fixing supported-device failures when a supported and unsupported Bluetooth device are connected at the same time.
- Device switching now swaps immediately to the selected device's cached state and ignores stale async refresh/apply results from the previously selected device, reducing DPI/control lag when multiple mice are connected.
- USB lighting apply/readback on Basilisk V3 35K now targets all three validated matrix LED zones (`0x01` scroll wheel, `0x04` logo, and `0x0A` underglow) instead of only the wheel zone.
- USB lighting effect encoding now matches the OpenRazer-documented matrix payloads for `off`, `spectrum`, `wave`, `reactive`, and breathing variants, fixing broken USB profile selections and removing an incorrect wave/spectrum mapping.
- USB button readback normalization now handles the Basilisk V3 35K `0x02:0x8C` response layout, which differs from the Basilisk V3 X slot echo shape and caused clutch/default blocks to be misparsed.
- USB button support now preserves and restores the Basilisk V3 35K top DPI-button default payload on slot `0x60`, and the app exposes the extra 35K-only USB slots for the wheel-tilt and DPI-button controls while keeping fixed-only special buttons labeled separately.
- Basilisk V3 35K button-slot hydration now rejects stale `0x02:0x8C` replies for the wrong echoed slot, and the shared 35K button layout now includes the validated wheel-tilt slots (`0x34`, `0x35`) with cleaned-up control labels.
- The button-binding UI now hides fixed-only 35K controls, and USB button bindings expose an explicit `DPI Cycle` action that can be assigned to any writable button while the 35K DPI button restores to a working DPI-cycle default.
- The USB lighting card now filters effect choices per device capability, keeps the original background treatment for `All Zones`, and only uses the multi-zone accent gradient when a specific static USB zone is selected.
- OpenSnek now reads the Basilisk V3 35K onboard profile summary on USB, exposes multi-profile UI only on devices that actually advertise multiple onboard profiles, and scopes USB button remap reads/writes to the selected stored profile instead of hard-coding profile 1.
- Device/profile docs now explicitly record the Basilisk V3 35K software-read-only controls: sensitivity clutch (`0x0F` / report-4 `0x51`) and profile button (`0x6A` / report-4 `0x50`), plus scroll-mode toggle (`0x0E`) as protocol-read-only.
- Shared button metadata now also marks the Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed Bluetooth Hypershift/sniper control (`slot 0x06`) as software-read-only so it appears in the unsupported-buttons footnote with the right explanation.
- The non-functional onboard-profile switcher card has been removed from the macOS UI until an actual active-profile switching path is decoded for supported devices.
- The button remap card now shows a compact per-device footnote for hidden unsupported buttons, including why each control is currently protocol-read-only or software-read-only.
- Python USB tooling now recognizes Basilisk V3 35K (`0x00CB`) and mirrors multi-zone USB lighting writes across all validated LED IDs.

### Changed
- App-level polling is now runtime-owned instead of view-timer-owned, allowing the full app to keep its current cadence while the background widget drops to a slower idle cadence and only boosts polling when the menu is open or a DPI change was just applied.
- Unsupported-button footnotes now use plain-language UI copy instead of protocol jargon, including the Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed sniper/Hypershift note.
- The polling-rate and scroll-control cards now align labels on the left and controls on the right to match the rest of the app.
- The empty-state supported-devices list now uses smaller inline USB/BT pills so more devices fit cleanly in one row.

## [2026-03-09]

### Changed
- Official app builds and GitHub macOS CI/release jobs now use the latest Xcode/macOS SDK while keeping the app deployment target at macOS 14 for backward compatibility on older supported systems.
- Runtime logging now has user-selectable levels with a macOS Settings page; the default level is now `Warning` to keep normal logs concise, while `Info` and `Debug` remain available for reproducing bug reports.
- Reorganized the repo around the macOS app: protocol/reference docs now live under `docs/`, supported Python tooling now lives under `tools/python/`, and the root entry point is now a zero-arg `./run.sh`.
- Split the Swift package into shared targets: `OpenSnekCore`, `OpenSnekProtocols`, `OpenSnekHardware`, and `OpenSnekAppSupport`, with the app and probe consuming those shared layers incrementally instead of keeping all architecture in the app target.
- Moved shared Swift domain models, device-profile metadata, button/turbo helpers, persistence key generation, BLE vendor framing, and USB HID report helpers out of `OpenSnek` local sources and into shared library targets.
- Rewrote `docs/protocol/BLE_PROTOCOL.md` around the Swift implementation as the source of truth, with complete transaction examples for every currently supported BLE vendor feature and a clearer split between wire-format rules and OpenSnek client policy.
- Device discovery in the macOS app now attaches resolved profile metadata to `MouseDevice`, including per-transport button layout and advanced-lighting support, so UI/app-state logic can rely on device capabilities instead of raw transport string branches.
- `AppState` now delegates patch coalescing and preference persistence to extracted support services (`ApplyCoordinator`, `DevicePreferenceStore`) instead of owning that logic directly.
- `OpenSnekProbe` now reuses shared BLE vendor and USB HID protocol helpers instead of maintaining fully separate copies of those framing/report builders.
- Bluetooth capture review now documents the shared BLE selector/frame lighting path (`10 03 = 0x00000008`, then repeated `10 04` frames), but OpenSnek keeps Bluetooth app lighting static-only for now because those advanced profiles appear to require software-driven streaming and are not yet shippable.

### Added
- Shared device-profile registry for the validated Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed family (`0x00B9` USB / `0x00BA` BLE) with explicit button-layout metadata.
- Unit tests for shared device-profile resolution/persistence keys and extracted apply coordination.
- GitHub Release DMG automation: tag-driven macOS workflow, Xcode archive/export release script, notarization/stapling path, and release credential setup docs.
- Pull-request CI workflow that runs the Swift package test suite on macOS.
- Root contribution guide covering new-device onboarding, capture interpretation, and validation expectations.

### Fixed
- Fixed a USB DPI-stage parsing regression introduced during the transport-layer split: stage-table reads were decoded one byte off, which corrupted stage values, broke on-mouse stage cycling, and could make the app collapse USB devices into the wrong stage count or single-stage mode.
- Release DMGs now preserve the macOS asset catalog and app icon in exported `OpenSnek.app` bundles.
- Release packaging now produces a styled drag-to-Applications DMG instead of a plain file-drop image.
- USB apply flows no longer fail immediately on transient post-write telemetry drops; readback now retries with short backoff and falls back to projected cached state when writes succeeded but immediate readback is temporarily unavailable.
- USB state reads now probe live DPI first and fail fast on non-responsive HID interfaces instead of running full telemetry sweeps on dead handles, removing long timeout storms that caused delayed/intermittent stage switching.
- USB transaction candidate handling now sticks to the last known-good transaction ID for normal traffic, reducing repeated per-command transaction scanning that amplified timeout latency on unstable sessions.
- USB DPI stage writes now preserve/report stage IDs and write active stage as the device stage-ID token (not raw UI index), fixing active-stage `0` timeout failures and off-by-one stage mapping during stage-count edits.
- Transient USB stage-table read failures no longer collapse state to single-stage fallback; cached stage values remain stable, and fast DPI polling now also runs on USB for quicker on-mouse stage-switch UI updates.
- Fast DPI refresh now preserves non-DPI USB telemetry fields (including low-battery threshold and scroll controls), fixing card flicker caused by transient nil resets during high-frequency stage polling.
- USB button remapping on Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed USB (`0x00B9`) now uses validated class `0x02` button-function commands (`0x0C` write / `0x8C` read) with correct 7-byte function-block encoding; remap writes/readback now succeed in hardware tests.
- USB startup hydration now reads button assignments from device readback (`0x02:0x8C`) before cache fallback, so launch/reconnect reflects real on-device button mappings instead of stale local `UserDefaults` values.

### Changed
- The macOS app now checks GitHub Releases on launch and shows a sidebar `New Version Available` button when a newer published release exists.

## [2026-03-08]

### Fixed
- Closing the main window with the macOS close button now terminates the app instead of leaving a background process running.
- BLE DPI stage value parsing no longer drops the last stage when read payload length is short by one byte.
- Active-stage selection now maps correctly to the stage actually selected on-device during mouse-button stage cycling.
- Removed unstable BLE active-stage nudge/toggle write behavior that caused stage-value collapse in some multi-stage transitions.
- Poll-rate telemetry/control visibility now respects capability detection (hidden for Bluetooth when unavailable).
- App activation now promotes the process to a regular foreground app on launch/reopen so windows reliably come frontmost.
- Keyboard button-binding text entry now applies with a short debounce instead of normalizing on each keystroke, allowing stable direct typing.
- HID permission denial (`kIOReturnNotPermitted`) no longer hard-fails device discovery; app now continues with best-effort BLE discovery/fallback.
- Bluetooth read/apply paths no longer require an IOHID handle, so BLE-only operation can continue when HID access is blocked.
- BLE runtime errors now report explicit CoreBluetooth state failures (unauthorized/powered-off/unsupported) instead of generic timeouts.
- BLE button remap UI now guards unsupported Bluetooth slot writes and uses capture-backed slot `0x60` for the DPI-cycle side control.
- BLE button remap now supports capture-backed DPI-cycle slot `0x60` writes and default-restore semantics (action `0x06`, `p0=0x0601`).
- BLE button remap no longer exposes slot `6` (`Hypershift/Boss key`) in the UI; runtime probes now document slot `6` as rejected (`status 0x03`) on the mapped BLE vendor key family.
- Lighting profile apply on Bluetooth no longer hard-fails when HID effect writes are unavailable; app now uses best-effort BLE fallback paths (`static`, `off`, `spectrum`) and keeps state/cache consistent.
- Persisted lighting state now re-applies automatically after reconnect/discovery instead of waiting for a fresh manual UI edit.
- USB HID feature-report framing in `OpenSnek` now matches device expectations (90-byte payload without extra leading byte), fixing missing USB telemetry/control cards where the app previously read request-echo frames (`status 0x00`) instead of real responses.
- USB state readback now evaluates all HID handle candidates and selects the highest-telemetry interface (DPI/poll/lighting weighted), avoiding partial USB sessions that only surfaced timeout/remap controls.
- Refresh/apply diagnostics are now explicit in-app: repeated read failures and partial USB telemetry states are surfaced as visible warnings/errors instead of being silently masked behind cache.
- USB permission diagnostics UI no longer renders duplicate overlapping red banners; input-monitoring failures now collapse to a single callout with host identity context.
- USB permission diagnostics now include stale-TCC guidance (`tccutil reset ListenEvent`) for local ad-hoc builds where macOS reports code-requirement mismatch despite a visible prior grant.
- USB core controls (DPI, polling, lighting) now remain visible for supported USB devices even when readback is temporarily partial; the UI surfaces a warning that values may be stale instead of hiding those cards.
- USB refresh now stops probing alternate HID interfaces once the preferred interface exposes DPI control telemetry, preventing 20s+ polling stalls that blocked applies and delayed UI updates.
- USB single-stage DPI writes now use a two-step persist/apply flow with readback retries, and HID response polling allows longer stale-frame drain windows, improving DPI write/readback convergence when a one-stage profile is configured.
- USB DPI stage editing is restored for USB mode (multi-stage count + active-stage selection), with active-stage readback now resolved from live DPI when stage index telemetry lags.
- USB button-binding UI now exposes `DPI Cycle` slot `96` (slot `6` remains hidden), and slot `96` default restore uses the capture-backed DPI-cycle action payload.

### Changed
- Replaced the macOS app icon artwork in `AppIcon.appiconset` with the new OpenSnek icon and cropped out the black background letterboxing from the source image.
- `OpenSnek/scripts/build_macos_app.sh` now automatically uses `AppIcon.appiconset/icon_512x512@2x.png` as the default app icon source instead of falling back to the generic macOS icon.
- `OpenSnek/scripts/build_macos_app.sh` now supports stable signing identities (`--sign-identity auto|adhoc|none|<identity>`) and auto-detects a local Apple signing cert when available, reducing TCC/Input Monitoring permission churn across rebuilds.
- `OpenSnek/scripts/build_macos_app.sh` now supports `--sign-identity preserve` and auto-reuses an existing app bundle signature in `auto` mode when available, helping keep TCC grants stable across rebuilds.
- `OpenSnek/scripts/build_macos_app.sh` `auto` signing now ignores existing ad-hoc signatures and prefers a real local signing identity when available, reducing TCC permission churn on rebuild.
- `OpenSnek/scripts/build_macos_app.sh` now applies a stable designated requirement when ad-hoc signing (`identifier "<bundle-id>"`) so Input Monitoring grants can persist across local rebuilds.
- `OpenSnek/scripts/run_macos_app.sh` continues to skip rebuilds unless explicitly requested; when rebuilding, it now defaults signing mode to `auto`.
- `OpenSnek` and `OpenSnekProbe` now decode BLE active stage using stage-id mapping from the current payload entries.
- BLE stage-table writes in Swift now preserve stage IDs from the current snapshot to keep UI stage selection aligned with hardware cycling.
- BLE protocol documentation now distinguishes protocol observations from per-client implementation behavior.
- `OpenSnek` UI is split into focused components (`ContentView`, `DeviceSidebarView`, `DeviceDetailView`, `UIPrimitives`) instead of a single monolithic view.
- Top-card lighting UX now uses integrated in-window controls (large brightness slider + inline color controls) instead of detached native color panel behavior.
- DPI telemetry now displays a single active DPI scalar value.
- Button remapping now uses a friendly-name table with per-button mapping summaries.
- Device metadata (name/protocol/battery) now renders as a standalone header above controls, with lighting moved into its own dedicated card.
- Redundant top stats strip and all auto-apply helper text were removed for a cleaner control-first layout.
- Button remap rows now right-align mapping menus and remove duplicate mapping summary text.
- Window/detail sizing is more fluid: smaller minimum window size plus adaptive split-view column widths.
- DPI stage editor now uses modern add/remove controls and stage-color accents (1 red, 2 green, 3 blue, 4 teal, 5 yellow).
- DPI stage mode toggle was removed; stage count now directly drives single-stage vs multi-stage behavior (1..5).
- Button remap labels now use user-facing names aligned to side-control order: slot `4` = `Back Button`, slot `5` = `Forward Button`, plus BLE slot `0x60` labeled `DPI Cycle`.
- BLE button UI now shows capture-backed writable slots (`1..5` + `0x60`) and labels slot `0x60` as `DPI Cycle`.
- Slot `6` (`Hypershift/Boss key`) support attempt on BLE was reverted after capture/runtime validation; the UI now hides slot `6` pending a decoded writable command path.
- BLE button remap now includes wheel-button slots `0x09`/`0x0A` (Scroll Up/Down) and exposes capture-backed scroll-up/scroll-down action mappings in both CLI and app payload builders.
- BLE button remap now supports turbo payload encoding on Bluetooth for mouse actions (`action 0x0E`) and keyboard bindings (`action 0x0D`) with UI toggle + rate control.
- Turbo slider is labeled as raw rate (`1` fastest, `255` slowest).
- Turbo control visibility now follows binding mode: hidden for `Default`, shown below the dropdown for non-default remaps.
- `Default` button remaps now restore per-slot native actions (left/right/middle/back/forward/scroll up/scroll down) instead of writing the generic `p0=0x0000` fallback.
- Turbo slider now uses Synapse-style `1..20` presses/second in the UI, with internal conversion to the existing raw BLE rate field.
- On fresh launch, button remap pickers now default to `Default` (neutral state) instead of pre-selecting slot action labels when no binding state has been read from hardware.
- Button remap selections are now cached per-device in UserDefaults using the mouse identifier, then restored on reconnect/launch (including turbo toggle/rate and keyboard key).
- Button remap rows now display friendly names without numeric slot prefixes.
- Button remap action label `Clear Layer` is now user-facing `Disabled`.
- Lighting brightness slider now uses a `0..100%` UI scale (mapped to the same raw `0..255` transport values).
- Slider controls now use continuous tracks without discrete step marker dots; value snapping is handled in setters where needed.
- Lighting card now exposes full scroll LED profile families (off, static, spectrum, wave, reactive, pulse random/single/dual) with per-profile controls (direction/speed/colors).
- Lighting profile state (mode + wave direction + reactive speed + secondary color) is now cached per device in UserDefaults and restored on reconnect/launch.
- Lighting/button persistence keys now use a stable per-device identity (`serial` when available, otherwise `VID:PID:transport`) with legacy-key fallback for previously cached values.
- Lighting profile picker has been temporarily removed from OpenSnek UI; app now exposes static lighting controls only while BLE effect parity remains unreliable on current macOS BT HID paths.
- OpenSnek lighting controls are now transport-scoped: USB exposes full effect/profile controls again, while Bluetooth remains static-only (brightness + color) to avoid BLE regressions.
- OpenSnek USB apply/readback now includes device mode (`00:84/04`), low-battery threshold (`07:81/01`), and scroll controls (`02:94/14`, `02:96/16`, `02:97/17`) with per-device capability probing.
- Unsupported USB controls are now hidden in the UI instead of shown disabled (device mode, low-battery threshold, and each individual scroll control).
- USB color-only writes now use the static matrix-effect path (`0x0F:0x02`) so RGB color edits apply reliably on USB.

### Added
- Hardware BLE DPI reliability test (`OPEN_SNEK_HW=1 swift test --package-path OpenSnek --filter HardwareDpiReliabilityTests`).
- Hardware USB button-remap test harness (`OPEN_SNEK_HW=1 swift test --package-path OpenSnek --filter HardwareUSBButtonRemapTests`) with write/readback/restore flow.
- Hardware USB startup hydration test harness (`OPEN_SNEK_HW=1 OPEN_SNEK_USB=1 swift test --package-path OpenSnek --filter HardwareUSBStartupHydrationTests`) that seeds conflicting cache and verifies startup rehydration prefers device state.
- Regression-focused validation workflow in `README.md`, `OpenSnek/README.md`, and `AGENTS.md` including CLI, hardware, and log-based checks.
- Sleep-timeout power-management control in UI plus USB (`07:83/03`) and BLE (`05 84/05 04`) bridge read/write plumbing.
- BLE lighting-frame color hydration path on startup (`10 84 00 00`) plus persisted per-device fallback when firmware does not return payload for this read.
- macOS app-bundle build scripts: `OpenSnek/scripts/build_macos_app.sh` and `OpenSnek/scripts/run_macos_app.sh` for dock/icon/focus-correct launches outside `swift run`.
- Xcode-distribution scaffold for macOS: `OpenSnek/project.yml` (XcodeGen spec), generated `OpenSnek/OpenSnek.xcodeproj`, and `OpenSnek/scripts/generate_xcodeproj.sh`.
- Native app asset catalog + AppIcon set under `OpenSnek/App/Resources/Assets.xcassets`.
- `OpenSnek/scripts/generate_appiconset.sh` to reproducibly regenerate all macOS app icon sizes from a single generated source.
- `OpenSnekProbe` USB HID commands for button remap validation (`usb-info`, `usb-button-read`, `usb-button-set`, `usb-button-set-raw`).
